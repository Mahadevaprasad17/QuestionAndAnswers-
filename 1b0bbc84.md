# Full Stack Development Exam - 20 Questions (10 Marks Each)

Based on the handwritten questions provided, here are comprehensive 10-mark answers for all 20 questions:

## 1. What is CORS? Why do we need a container?

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):**
CORS is a security mechanism implemented by web browsers that allows or restricts web pages from making requests to a domain different from the one serving the web page. It's a browser-enforced security feature that prevents potentially malicious scripts from accessing resources from different origins without proper authorization.

**Key aspects of CORS:**
- Origins are defined by scheme (protocol), domain, and port
- Browsers block cross-origin requests by default for security
- CORS headers allow servers to specify which origins can access their resources
- Common CORS headers include Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods

**Why we need containers:**
Containers provide isolated environments for applications, ensuring consistency across different deployment environments. They package applications with all dependencies, making deployment predictable and scalable.

**Benefits of containers:**
- Environment consistency between development and production
- Resource efficiency compared to virtual machines
- Rapid deployment and scaling capabilities
- Isolation of applications and their dependencies
- Improved portability across different platforms
- Better resource utilization through shared host OS kernel

## 19. Explain Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

[Note: This is a repeat of Question 15. Here's a comprehensive answer with additional focus on implementation details]

**Blue-Green Deployment Strategy Implementation:**

**Advanced Blue-Green Concepts:**

**1. Database Management in Blue-Green:**

**Schema Evolution Strategy:**
- Backward-compatible database changes
- Feature flags for database features
- Database migration automation
- Data synchronization mechanisms

**Database Approaches:**
- **Shared Database**: Both environments use same DB
- **Separate Databases**: Independent databases with sync
- **Read Replicas**: Green reads from Blue's replica
- **Event Sourcing**: Event-based data consistency

**2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

**Terraform Example:**
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "blue_environment" {
  count         = var.blue_active ? var.instance_count : 0
  ami           = var.app_ami
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  
  tags = {
    Name = "blue-app-${count.index}"
    Environment = "blue"
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "green_environment" {
  count         = var.green_active ? var.instance_count : 0
  ami           = var.app_ami
  instance_type = var.instance_type
  
  tags = {
    Name = "green-app-${count.index}"
    Environment = "green"
  }
}

resource "aws_lb_target_group_attachment" "app" {
  count            = var.blue_active ? var.instance_count : 0
  target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.app.arn
  target_id        = aws_instance.blue_environment[count.index].id
  port             = 80
}
```

**3. Load Balancer Configuration:**

**NGINX Configuration:**
```nginx
upstream blue {
    server blue1.example.com:80;
    server blue2.example.com:80;
}

upstream green {
    server green1.example.com:80;
    server green2.example.com:80;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://blue;  # Switch to green during deployment
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

**4. Automated Deployment Pipeline:**

**CI/CD Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Build Stage**: Compile and package application
2. **Test Stage**: Run unit and integration tests
3. **Deploy to Green**: Deploy new version to inactive environment
4. **Smoke Tests**: Basic functionality verification
5. **Load Testing**: Performance validation
6. **Traffic Switch**: Route traffic to Green environment
7. **Monitor**: Continuous monitoring post-deployment
8. **Cleanup**: Prepare Blue for next deployment

**5. Monitoring and Observability:**

  periodSeconds: 10

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /ready
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 5
```

**6. Rollback Procedures:**

spec:
  hosts:
  - app-service
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        canary:
          exact: "true"
    route:
    - destination:
        host: app-service
        subset: canary
      weight: 100
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: app-service
        subset: stable
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: app-service
        subset: canary
      weight: 10
```

**2. Feature Flag Integration:**

**Feature Toggle Implementation:**
```javascript
// Feature flag service
class FeatureToggleService {
  constructor(configService) {
    this.config = configService;
  }
  
  isEnabled(featureName, userId) {
    const feature = this.config.getFeature(featureName);
    
    if (feature.rolloutStrategy === 'canary') {
      return this.isUserInCanaryGroup(userId, feature.canaryPercentage);
    }
    
    return feature.enabled;
  }
  
  isUserInCanaryGroup(userId, percentage) {
    const hash = this.hashUserId(userId);
    return (hash % 100) < percentage;
  }
}
```

**3. Canary Analysis:**
